# iOS14Spoofer

this project was originally `RedditOSVersionSpoofer`, however i have renamed it to iOS14Spoofer since it looks like some other apps (like Spotify) use the same method as Reddit for checking the host OS version. you can get a dylib to inject into IPAs here: https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/iOS14Spoofer/releases/tag/v1.0.0
